# Map population change
In this repository, I demonstrate how to map population changes in Kenya between 1990 and 2020 using ggplot2 in R. I utilize the GHSL population data, which offers high-resolution population rasters for the entire globe. By calculating the difference between the 1990 and 2020 rasters, I determine the population change for each pixel.
